# Mod20_Segment_1
By the end of this module segment, we will have created the foundation for the final project. By defining roles between team members and establishing a communication structure. Additionally, Decide on a topic for the project—think of a question that can be answered using data. Create a repository for the project and invite the other team members to join. Source a dataset that will suit your needs (you can even use multiple datasets if applicable). Begin to clean, organize, and perform exploratory data analysis on your datasets so that they're ready for analysis. Include mockups of a machine learning model and a database.

# Purpose 

First Segment: Sketch It Out: Decide on your overall project, select your question, and build a simple model. You'll connect the model to a fabricated database, using comma-separated values (CSV) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files, to prototype your idea.

# Presentation 

* Selected topic:

* Reason we selected the topic:

* Description of the source of data:

Minimum of 1,000 data points,using either Kaggle, data.world, government sites, Web scraping. 

* Questions we hope to answer with the data:


# Github

* Description of the communication protocols:

Create direct messages for only team members in Slack:
Establish a daily meetup time for everyone: 
Communication protocol in case of an emergency: 
whom to contact, whether an emergency message should be sent through Slack or email, and so forth.

* Individual Branches:
There is one branch for each team member as follows:

* Each team member has at least four commits for the duration of the first segment:

# Machine Learning Model

We will present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:

* Takes in data from the provisional database
* Outputs label for input data

Questions
•	Which model did you choose and why?
•	How are you training your model?
•	What is the model's accuracy?
•	How does this model work?


# Database 

Present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following:
* Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema
* Draft machine learning model is connected to the provisional database

# Technologies Used

•	Which tools are the best fit for your project? 
•	What will be used for each section? 
•	For example, data cleaning and data storage will be completed using two different tools. 
•	How will the dashboard be built? 

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
Mongo is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is ___. Extra ML verbiage here.

# Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on ___.

There are no deliverables associated with the dashboard for this segment.
